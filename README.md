A home equity line of credit, or HELOC, is a loan in which the lender agrees to lend a maximum amount within an agreed period (called a term), where the collateral is the borrower's equity in their house (akin to a second mortgage). Because a home often is a consumer's most valuable asset, many homeowners use home equity credit lines only for major items, such as education, home improvements, or medical bills, and choose not to use them for day-to-day expenses. HELOC abuse is often cited as one cause of the subprime mortgage crisis.

In this project, our team aim to correctly predict whether the applicants of HELOC will repay their accounts or not. We build different classification models with Random Forest achieving a 74% accuracy.

Random Forest

## Model Selection And Evaluation

After using cross validation to evaluate the models, we find that random forest with 28 trees outperformed other models. It achieves a 74% accuracy. Although more and deeper trees will make the accuracy even higher, it also makes the model much more conputationally expensive.
